# Women-Affair-Prediction

I decided to treat this as a classification problem by creating a new
binary variable affair (did the woman have at least one affair?) and trying to
predict the classification for each woman. <br>
## Dataset <br>
The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with
Statsmodels. It
was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook
magazine, in
which married women were asked about their participation in
extramarital
affairs. More information about the study is available in a 1978
paper from
the Journal of Political Economy.<br>
